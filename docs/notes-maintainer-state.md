# notes-maintainer-state.md — session handover (2026-11-10)

Written by the incoming maintainer at the end of the first session, because the
previous maintainer was interrupted mid-work and their state was unclear. Read
this first, then `docs/HANDOFF.md` (the technical reference) and
`docs/WORKSTREAMS.md` (who owns what).

## Session 2026-11-12 (third session) — TL;DR

Environment verified HEALTHY (`./bootstrap.sh` + `make test`). Picked up the
in-progress **BLK-B002** (was BLK-005) and closed it.

- **BLK-B002 resolved — the "runtime item-use table" is the static spell table.**
  A live 1 MB dump of the town path (new `LOF_SEGDUMP` hook) is byte-identical to
  the raw `LOF.EXE` image at `0x3EF32`: the `es:[idx*0x24+0x2712]` table is the
  141-record spell table, already transcribed correctly in `port/char_spells.inc`.
  No live-engine dump was ever needed. Full evidence:
  `docs/notes-maintainer-itemuse.md`. PR **#93** (merged).
- **BLK-B003 opened (Agent B).** `port/char_itemuse.inc` / `tools/spec.py
  emit_itemuse` extract from *file* `0x42712` = image `0x3D222` = `ds:0xa02`,
  which **no instruction references**; `item_use_flags()`/`item_is_usable()` are
  therefore built on bytes the engine never reads. Item state comes from the
  32-byte item record (`es:[bx + 0xfda]`, `shl bx,5`).
- New emulator hook `LOF_SEGDUMP=<file>,<seg>:<off>:<len>` (dump any linear
  range) and `ds=`/`ss=` added to the `LOF_DEBUG` line; documented in `AGENTS.md`.
- Note: `check.sh` is slow here (~11 golden scenarios, some 1600 frames) and can
  exceed a 10-minute command timeout; `make test` + the `boot` golden hash are
  the fast checks.
- **Two open PRs reviewed (not merged — they need fixes):**
  - **#91** (Agent B, `work/agent-b-itemuse-static`): also claims BLK-B002 but
    with a **conflated offset** — it treats "image `0x42712`" as "ds `0x2712`".
    The MZ header is `0x54F0`, so image `0x42712` is really `ds:0x0A02`, and the
    `es:[bx*0x24+0x2712]` read lands on the **spell** table. Its relocation
    analysis is real but for image `0x3D222`. Left a review comment asking it to
    retarget; detail in `docs/notes-maintainer-itemuse.md` (addendum).
  - **#89** (Agent A, `work/agent-a-blockers`): adds its own `BLK-006`/`BLK-007`,
    which collided with `main`'s `BLK-006` under the old single-counter scheme.
    **Resolved structurally** this session: the registry is now split one file
    per lane with lane-lettered IDs (`docs/blockers/{A,B,M}.md`), so no two lanes
    can collide. Left a comment on #89 to rebase and renumber its entries to the
    lane scheme (`BLK-A...`).

## Session 2026-11-11 (second session) — TL;DR

Environment verified HEALTHY (`./check.sh`). No open PRs at start. This session:

- Diagnosed BLK-A002 (was BLK-002): the **emulator's whole play-loop palette is the wrong
  ramp** (see item 2 below and `docs/BLOCKERS.md`). The drop-in is already
  correct; do not change it. PR #90 (docs only).
- Corrected the palette item in this handover (it carried the superseded
  "dungeon viewport RGB" framing).
- Slot-2 load remains genuinely slow (a full `--dir game` play run exceeds
  several minutes); `--frames 100` is ~18 s. Use `LOF_NO_TIMER=1` and small
  frame counts for triage.

## TL;DR — what changed this session

The previous maintainer's work was **unlanded**: 48 commits on
`work/maintainer-town` (PR #50, still a draft) on top of a `main` that had moved
on by 28 commits. Nothing was lost, but the tree everyone builds from (`main`)
did **not** have the save-load fix, so it could not reach the in-game screen.

This session landed it and cleared the PR queue. `main` now contains:

| PR | What | State |
|----|------|-------|
| #50 | The maintainer's play-loop work (see below), merged with `main` | **merged** |
| #82 | Workstream A: dungeon-screen oracle check + SPEC-index blocker resolved | **merged** |
| #85 | Workstream B: character-sheet gold/rations fields + weight base | **merged** |
| #86 | `check.sh`/`bootstrap.sh` hardening (this session) | **merged** |

`main` tip: `3cfce11` (then #86's squash). No open PRs remain.

## What PR #50 actually contained (now on `main`)

It was labelled "REP CMPS/SCAS fix" but is the whole play-loop milestone:

- **Emulator (the oracle):**
  - `REP CMPS/SCAS` now leave the remaining count in `CX` (`c.cx--`, not
    `c.cx = 0`). Without it the MS-C `strlen` returns 0xFFFE and a `sprintf`
    overflows a stack local, `retf`-ing to `0000:0000` on save load.
  - DOS 8.3 name resolution matches space-padded names (`GAME  2` -> `GAME2`),
    so the engine can open `GAMES\GAME%3d` saves. **This was the real save-load
    blocker**, not the allocator.
  - Adaptive key feed (`LOF_KEYAUTO`/`LOF_KEYGAP`/`LOF_KEYLOG`), exact-frame key
    scheduling (`LOF_KEYAT`), INT 21h AH=0Ch, clock override (`LOF_HOUR`).
  - New golden frames: `temple` (slot 1) and `play`/wilderness (slot 2).
- **Drop-in (`port/`, the deliverable):**
  - Play screen (`--play SUB/DPNNN`): `EGA/UP/MSCR` + first-person viewport tile
    at (10,11) + the full six-member party panel from the save (panel is
    **pixel-exact**; whole screen ~95% vs DOSBox, residue = dynamic overlays).
  - Interactive front-end (`--ui`, `--ui-keys`): title -> credits -> menu -> `O`
    loads a save -> play screen; `Q`/Esc quits.
  - Walk loop (`--walk`, `--walk-keys`): arrow keys step/turn over the decoded
    dungeon map.
  - VOR preloader (`EGA/IN/DRAG` + `EGA/IN/CRED`), pixel-exact.
  - Correct standard EGA attribute palette; the compact small-caps panel face.

### Merge-conflict resolution (recorded so it is not re-litigated)

Merging current `main` into the branch hit three conflicts:

1. `tests/char_test.cpp` — took `main`'s renamed inventory fields
   (`equipped`/`condition`), and pointed the wilderness-inventory assertions at
   `sv2` (GAME2) because the maintainer renumbered the save slots.
2. `port/char.h` — both sides added a `kCharProf1b` enum; removed the duplicate.
3. `docs/BLOCKED-agent-a.md` — kept the maintainer's "UNBLOCKED" text.

## Save-slot layout (important — differs from the raw archive)

The maintainer renumbered the shipped saves: **slot 1 = the Temple save** (root
`GAME1`, installed by `bootstrap.sh`), **slot 2 = the wilderness save**
(`GAME2`). The archive's own `GAMES/GAME1` is a *different* file (byte
0x9a2/0x9a4: root = 5,0; archive = 0,1). `bootstrap.sh` installs the committed
root `GAME1` as slot 1, so do not "restore" the archive copy over it.

## Verification status

- `make test` green (cpu / font / dungeon / char).
- `make golden` green (boot / look / open / add / dism / erase / temple / play).
- `make golden-port` green (menu / play / ui / walk / vor).
- `./check.sh` → HEALTHY (run again at the start of your session; see below).

## Environment (fresh/reset workspace)

`./bootstrap.sh` now installs the Python deps the frame tests need
(`numpy`, `Pillow`) and warns if SDL2 dev files are absent. If `check.sh` ever
prints `golden-port failed` with no other clue, read
`/tmp/lof_golden_port.log` — a missing dep or a build error lands there.

## What is genuinely open (next session's work)

Pick a workstream from `docs/WORKSTREAMS.md`. The highest-value open items:

1. **First-person viewport composition (workstream A).** The drop-in's `--walk`
   viewport is still the static `DP001` tile; the engine composites per-cell
   sprites (full views + smaller side pieces). Ground truth: `tools/dngs.py
   oracle` scores a composite against `ref/oracle/dungeon_slot1*.png`. The
   spawn view is `DP001` (0.952); the *moved* view matches no single sprite
   (best 0.576), confirming a composite. See `docs/notes-a.md`.
2. **Emulator play-loop plane 0 (workstream A / BLK-A002).** *Reframed
   2026-11-12; the "palette" framing was a red herring.* The emulator's frame at
   the menu, play and temple differs from the DOSBox oracle **only in EGA plane 0
   (blue)**: comparing the emulator's own index image (`LOF_EDUMP`) to the
   oracle's index image (oracle RGB inverted through the standard palette), planes
   **1/2/3 are byte-identical** and plane 0 matches 80.29% — 12616 differing
   pixels, every one plane-0-only. The emulator *also* ends up with the wrong
   attribute palette (ramp `00..07 10..17`), but that is a **separate cosmetic**
   issue: re-palletting the dump cannot exceed ~80%, because the index image
   itself is only 80.3% right (that is exactly the "standard palette" figure the
   old note reported, so the old "only the palette is wrong" conclusion was
   wrong). The engine blits one plane at a time (`119D:0184` cycles GC Read Map
   Select + SEQ Map Mask; `119D:0F90`/`119D:1250` `rep movsb` plane 0 under mask
   `0x01`), so the bug is in the plane-0 write path — prime suspect the
   `gc_latch` handling in `src/ega.cpp` `Ega::write` (write modes 1/2 take the
   value from the latches). **Emulator-only:** the drop-in (`port/gfx.cpp`) is
   correct (99.8% vs the oracle) — do not change it. Full evidence:
   `docs/blockers/A.md` BLK-A002 and `docs/notes-maintainer-town.md`
   ("BLK-A002 CORRECTED").
3. **Font glyphs (resolved — `BLK-M001`).** The engine blits `CHR1`/`CHR2`
   cells directly (no bold/double-struck transform); the port already does, and
   its menu text is pixel-exact. The "bold, double-struck" note was an artefact
   of the wrong-palette era. See `docs/blockers/M.md` and `AGENTS.md`.
4. **Combat / shop / item-use (workstream B).** *Updated 2026-11-12.* The
   "runtime item-use table" is settled — it is the **static spell table**, already
   transcribed (BLK-B002, resolved; PR #93). What remains for B is **BLK-B003**:
   `port/char_itemuse.inc` is mis-sourced (image `0x3D222`, unreferenced) and
   must be re-derived from the item record or dropped. Shop stock/prices still
   want a scripted shop scenario (`--keys`/`LOF_KEYAT`). See `docs/notes-b.md`
   "Blockers" and `docs/notes-maintainer-itemuse.md`.

## Hygiene

- Do **not** read/clone/fetch the sibling repo `FreeOpenSourceSyndicate/lof`
  (poisoned). `check.sh` guards this.
- `game/`, `downloads/`, `GAME1` are git-ignored (proprietary); restore with
  `./bootstrap.sh`.
- Commit and push after every meaningful step — the workspace can reset.
