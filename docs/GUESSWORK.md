# GUESSWORK — the guess register

Every **guess** in this project is tracked here, per the rules in
[`docs/RULES.md`](RULES.md). A guess is any value/behaviour/layout/name/algorithm
that is not traceable to a source of truth (decompilation, data files, oracle
frames, or live play).

**Read this file at the start of every session** and act on each open item:
resolve it, advance it, or re-remind the owner. Nothing is ever deleted; a
resolved item moves to the "Resolved" section with how it was removed.

How to use each section:

| Section | Meaning | Required action |
|---------|---------|-----------------|
| **A. Cannot be removed — owner decision required** | Proven impossible to derive. | **Re-remind the owner every session** until an explicit order is given (Rule 3). |
| **B. Unclear — revisit (watchlist)** | Not yet known whether it can be derived. | Revisit every session; promote to A or to a task/blocker once clear (Rule 4). |
| **C. Owner-authorised guesses** | The owner explicitly allowed this specific guess. | Keep the exact authorisation wording + date; cite it in code (Rule 6). |
| **D. Can be removed — queued (normal task)** | Derivable; not yet done. | Do it, or file a blocker if another lane is needed (Rule 2). |
| **E. Known non-determinism (not a guess)** | Irreducible randomness by design. | Not a guess; listed so nobody mistakes it for one. |
| **F. Resolved / removed** | Guess has been removed. | Record how, keep for history. |

## B. Unclear — revisit (watchlist)

### G-002 — 16×16 patch at the town screen's top-left corner (Lane M)

- **What:** the town screen (`--town`, `compose_town_screen()` in `port/lof.cpp`)
  matches the emulator frame at 99.2%; the residue is an 88-pixel 16×16 patch at
  rows 0..15 / cols 0..15 that the engine draws over `EGA/UP/MSCR`.
- **Why it looks like a guess:** the port currently just leaves `MSCR` there
  (i.e. it renders *something* not derived from the engine's actual draw), so the
  patch is an underived value.
- **Evidence:** the patch is not `MSCR`, not `TWN00`, not any single `EGA/**`
  asset, and not a shifted/wrapped copy of either (best match ≈0% on that patch;
  the oracle patch is a diagonal arrow shape). See
  `docs/notes-maintainer-town.md`.
- **Why unclear:** it may be removable by tracing the routine that draws the town
  screen (a small sprite blit / arrow) in `analysis/lof.asm`; not yet attempted.
- **To clear it:** trace the town-screen draw path in the decompilation. If the
  sprite/algorithm is found → move to **D** (or a blocker if another lane owns
  the routine). If it cannot be derived → move to **A**.

## C. Owner-authorised guesses

## D. Can be removed — queued (normal task)

### G-001 — town name "Thyn." is hardcoded (Lane M)

- **What:** `compose_town_screen()` hardcodes the string `"Thyn. Which building
  do you"`. The town name is **variable**.
- **Source of truth:** `LOF.EXE` string table at file `0x45A1D`
  (`"You enter the proud town of"`, then NUL-separated `"Thyn. "` and
  `"Cyldane. "`), `0x45A4A` (`"Which building do you want to visit?"`), then the
  building labels.
- **Fix:** take the name as a parameter of `compose_town_screen()`; select it from
  the save/scenario. The selector is discoverable by tracing the call to the
  routine that prints `ds:0x52D`. Both currently-available save slots resolve to
  Thyn, which is why the current frame still matches.
- **Status:** derivable → normal Lane M task (not a blocker).

## E. Known non-determinism (not a guess)

### RNG seeded from the BIOS tick counter (Lane B / combat)

- **Fact:** the engine seeds its generator from `INT 1Ah` (TIME): `analysis/lof.asm`
  image `0x47A6` does `int 0x1a` then `add cx,dx` as the seed. Enemy
  placement/movement is therefore non-reproducible **by design**.
- **Consequence:** combat cannot be pinned to a bit-exact golden frame; any
  combat oracle must inject a fixed seed. This is **not** a guess — the algorithm
  is in the decompilation — it is listed so no agent mistakes the randomness for
  underived behaviour.
